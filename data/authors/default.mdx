Hello, I'm <span className="about-hight">Shevon</span>, a web developer from China with <span className="about-hight">experience in three internet companies</span>. I specialize in front-end development, <span className="about-hight">using React and Vue.js</span> to create engaging web applications. While I primarily focus on front-end, my background in computer networking enables me to handle backend tasks, and I am gradually <span className="about-hight">becoming a full-stack developer</span>.

I have a <span className="about-hight">passion for hands-on exploration, paying attention to detail, and creating aesthetically pleasing designs</span>. I have strong skills in big data visualization and smart IoT solutions. My development expertise spans multiple platforms, including PC, responsive design, mobile H5, and WeChat Mini Programs. I enjoy the challenge of making user interfaces work seamlessly across different devices.

I enjoy the flexibility of remote work and also value maintaining a <span className="about-hight">healthy work-life balance</span>. In my free time, I am a clay crafting enthusiast and literature explorer. I also enjoy watching American TV shows like 'Modern Family' and 'Friends'. As a fan of rock music, I appreciate bands like Bon Jovi and Wu Bai. To stay active, I play table tennis and go running.

Welcome to my personal website! <span className="about-hight">Feel free to reach out for a chat or send me an email at shevonnet@163.com</span>.
